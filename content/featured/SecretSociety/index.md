[Secret Society](https://github.com/deepakviswanadh/mern-CloakBoard) is a MERN Stack Web based-blogging application where users with an account can create blogs and can decide to share it to a wall. The post visibility on the wall can be customised by the user in a way that only registered users can view the posts or it can be viewed by anyone. Users with no accounts can only view the posts in the wall. The entire login flow is JWT authenticated and encrypted. Users can signup and can start either creating blogs or can respond to blogs created by other users. The application follows MVC architecture and the entire state management is handled using Redux-Thunk. The styling is custom built with popup and toast notifications.
