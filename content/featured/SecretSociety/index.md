[Secret Society](https://github.com/deepakviswanadh/mern-CloakBoard) is a Full stack web based-blogging application where users with an account can create blogs and can decide to share it to a wall. The post visibility on the wall can be customised by the user in a way that only registered users can view the posts or it can be viewed by anyone. The entire login flow is JWT authenticated and encrypted. Users can signup and can start either creating blogs or can respond to blogs created by other users.
