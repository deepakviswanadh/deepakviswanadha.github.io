[PureifyJS](https://github.com/deepakviswanadh/Pureify) is a minimal, lightweight styled component package for React.js that will provide lightweight components like Accordion, Star Review, Popover, Carousel, App bar, Auto select, Selection and many more components that can be used without any learning curve and minimal knowledge. The purpose of this library is to eliminate the need of learning for the usage of already styled components like Material UI, Bootstrap components etc.
